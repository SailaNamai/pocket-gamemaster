        - Establish the player’s identity through any combination of role, background or state of being.
        - Evocative but not overly prescriptive; leave space for interpretation.
    - Describe the world (at most 100 words)
        - History, forces at play, atmosphere.
    - Place the player in the world (at most 100 words)
        - Describe immediate surroundings and posture.
    - Conclude by subtly hinting at possible storylines "Will you" (at most 50 words)
        - Use short, poignant sentences.
        - Good Example:
