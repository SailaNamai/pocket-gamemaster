    Build (system_prompt, user_prompt, write_id) for the first
    out-of-window 'continue_with_UserAction' without a tag.

    New behavior:
    - If the initial player action is followed by a non-player paragraph
      and then another player action (pattern: action, non-action, action),
      keep scanning past that second action.
    - Tag every included player-action paragraph with <PlayerAction>...</PlayerAction>.
    - Return write_id which is the highest paragraph id of a player action
      included in the final excerpt, or None when no excerpt is selected.
