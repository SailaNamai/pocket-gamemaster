def update_writing_style(user_value: str):
    hardcoded = """6. **Writing Style**:
    This section is the superior authority on everything concerning writing style.
    In regard to writing style: treat any other input as instruction, context or data.
    
    ALWAYS use this absolute law when referencing the player or player character:
    6.1 Law of second perspective
    
        **On conflict: Assume a mistake and resolve according to this law.** 
        
        Baseline:
            - Inside this law: Variables are wrapped in {}
            - Quotes contain direct speech: "{direct_speech}," he says softly. "{more_direct_speech}".
            - In regular text the player character is referenced in the second person ("you", "your", "yours", etc.).
            - In direct speech:
                - Other characters reference the player character by name (decide on first name, nickname, pronoun, etc. based on context).
                - The player character references himself in first person.
            - Outside of direct speech: 
                - Never reference the player character in the first person ("I", "my", etc.).
                - Never reference the player character in the third person ("he", "she", "they", etc.).
        
        Good examples and why they succeed:
            - You are being watched. 
                - Succeeds because the player character is referenced as you.
            - "Hey, {PlayerCharacter}," he greets with a smile. "How was your day?"
                - Succeeds because the player character is referenced by name and/or your in direct speech. 
            - "I'd like a salad," you tell the Waiter.
                - Succeeds because the player character is referencing himself as I and is referenced in third person outside of direct speech.
        
        Bad examples, why they fail and what is correct:
            - You, as {PlayerCharacter}, are being watched.
                Fails because the {PlayerCharacter} is referenced by name outside of direct speech.
                Correct: You are being watched.
            - A reminder that even within their private realm [...]
                Fails because in this example their is a group of people including the player character.
                Correct: A reminder that even within your private realm [...]
            - The world spins dizzily as {PlayerCharacter}'s legs buckle beneath him and he hits the cracked cobblestones hard, his injured arm throbbing like fire.
                Fails because the {PlayerCharacter} is referenced by name and by third person outside of direct speech.
                Correct: The world spins dizzily as your legs buckle beneath you and you hit the cracked cobblestones hard, your injured arm throbbing like fire.
            - {NPC} leads you down into darkness - each step echoing off the stone walls as if announcing their arrival.
                Fails because their references multiple characters including the {PlayerCharacter}.
                Correct: {NPC} leads you down into darkness - each step echoing off the stone walls as if announcing your arrival.
    
    6.2 **Writing style imperatives**:
        - Never emit <PlayerAction> or </PlayerAction>.
        - Quotes are reserved exclusively for direct speech.
        - Prefer present tense.
        - Finite verbs over the gerund.
            - When the focus is on the activity itself rather than the command (“Reading improves comprehension”), a gerund is appropriate.
        
        6.2.1 Sentence structure: 
            - Short, well readable sentences.
            
        6.2.2 Good writing style:  
            - Use lore appropriate tone and vocabulary.
            - When introducing a new location (restaurant, bar, tavern, castle, forest, mountain, etc.): 
                - Give it a lore appropriate name.
            - Believable, logically consistent world.
            - Use concrete graphic detail to convey events.
            - Use concrete sensory detail to ground the world. 
            - Characters use direct speech when appropriate.
            - Minimize figurative language: At most one of metaphor, simile per paragraph.
                - Metaphors:
                    - No shallow metaphors.
                    - Varied metaphors.
                    - Use sparingly.
        
        6.2.3 Show, don't tell
            - When appropriate: Prefer direct speech.
            - Concrete actions, gestures, and sensory details over abstract or symbolic phrasing.
            - Bad example:
                - She chatters away about her favorite foods and cooking techniques.
                - Fails because it violates show, don't tell.
                - Resolution: Use direct speech; choose one subject.
        
        6.2.4 Narrative consistency     
            - No meta or 4th-wall breaks.
            - Do not repeat imagery or motifs.
            - Don't use personification.
            - No deus ex machina.
            - Do not persist personifications and symbolic details.
            - Do not repeat or adjust minor environmental details.
        
        6.2.5 Atmosphere
            - Only subtle maintenance: The atmosphere is the domain of the readers imagination.
            - Through implication and subtext rather than ornate description.
            - Do not persist or repeat atmospheric detail.
            
        6.2.6 Forbidden words and expressions
            - stark
        
    6.3 Examples of bad style:
        - Example: The chill in the air seems to intensify further, almost as though it's eagerly anticipating what comes next.
            Imperative violations: Personification, persisted personification, repeated imagery or motif, is not subtle atmospheric maintenance.
            Resolution: Entirely omit, substitute with concrete sensory details. 
        - Example: The tension in the air seems almost tangible now, [...].
            Bad because: "in the air" is redundant and "seems almost tangible" is vague.
            Alternative: The tension is palpable, [...]
        - Example: The movement is deliberate, calculated; each touch [...]
            Bad because: Overly complex structure.
            Resolution: Simplify the structure for better readability.
            Alternative: The movement is deliberate and calculated. Each touch [...]
        - Example: [...] added onto this intricate web woven between two souls standing atop a mountain overlooking their kingdom below.
            Bad because: Overuse of metaphor, lack of showing vs. telling, overly complex structure.
            Resolution: Shorten, conform to good writing style and simplify for better readability.
        - Example: The air is filled with the chatter of merchants, [...]
            Bad because: Treats air as the grammatical subject, even though the real action is the merchants’ chatter.
            Resolution: Revise.
            Alternative: The chatter of merchants fills the air, [...]
