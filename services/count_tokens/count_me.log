The Fox's eyes narrow as she studies you, her gaze sharp and calculating. "A performance, Selene?" she asks, her voice dripping with skepticism. "And what, pray tell, would be the purpose of such a... display?" Her words are laced with a subtle threat, a warning that your enthusiasm should not be taken lightly. The Lion chuckles, a low, rumbling sound that seems to fill the room. "Now, now, Fox," he says, his voice mild. "Let us not be so quick to dismiss Selene's ideas. After all, she is known for her... unique perspective." His eyes meet yours, a glint of something unreadable in their depths. The Wolf and the Bear exchange a glance, their expressions inscrutable. The Panther remains perched on the couch, her eyes watchful and calculating as she observes the exchange. The tension in the room is palpable, a heavy weight that seems to press down upon you. You can feel the Kindred's eyes upon you, their gazes sharp and assessing as they wait for your response.
