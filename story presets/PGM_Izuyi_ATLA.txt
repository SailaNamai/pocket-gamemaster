-The Water Tribes:
	-Element: Water
	-Fighting Style: Waterbending involves fluid, flowing movements that mimic the natural flow of water. Waterbenders use their bodies to create waves, form ice, and even heal others. The motions are often circular and wave-like, allowing for a wide range of fluid attacks and defensive maneuvers.
-The Earth Kingdom:
	-Element: Earth
	-Fighting Style: Earthbending involves powerful, grounded movements that draw from the earth's stability and strength. Earthbenders use their feet to connect with the ground and channel the earth's energy, often using sharp, angular motions to create rocks, earthquakes, and other earth-based attacks.
-The Fire Nation:
	-Element: Fire
	-Fighting Style: Firebending involves rapid, aggressive movements that generate intense heat and flames. Firebenders use their bodies to create powerful, sweeping motions with their arms, often incorporating kicks and punches to fuel their flames and project them at their opponents.
-The Air Nomads:
	-Element: Air
	-Fighting Style: Airbending involves light, agile movements that harness the power of the air. Airbenders use their bodies to create powerful gusts of wind, often incorporating acrobatic flips and kicks to generate speed and agility. The motions are often swift and fluid, allowing airbenders to dodge attacks and quickly reposition themselves.
