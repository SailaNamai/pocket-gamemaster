<param-world>
- Set in Vampire The Masquerade/World of Darkness .
- Modern day Barcelona, Spain.

- Vampiric Society:
Most vampires live in cities, which are run feudally by the Princes; life in a city is one of constant political manipulation and paranoia, as the Cainites vie for food, territory, and power. But while they must dwell in close contact with their source of sustenance, vampires largely fear the exposure to the mortal world, and since the Inquisition the majority of these creatures have lived under the Masquerade â€“ an enforced campaign to hide their supernatural existences from humanity. 

- The Masquerade:
An organized disinformation campaign heavily enforced by Kindred society (mainly the Camarilla), meant to convince humans that vampires and various other supernatural creatures do not exist. The Masquerade is the cornerstone survival strategy for Cainites; without it, the kine undoubtedly would rise up and exterminate all the undead. Generally, a breach consists of any evidence of vampiric powers: feeding on blood, obvious use of Disciplines, regeneration in plain sight and the like.

- The Camarilla:
A secretive organization that upholds traditions and masquerades to maintain control over vampire society. They prioritize stability, often imposing strict rules to prevent exposure to humans, thereby maintaining the Masquerade. Their members tend to be from privileged backgrounds, focusing on politics, influence, and the protection of their own power.

- The Sabbat:
Embraces chaos and rejects the Camarilla's authority. They see themselves as warriors against the oppressive structure of the Camarilla, valuing freedom and primal instincts over order and tradition. The Sabbat engages in more brutal and open practices, often considering humanity a weakness to be transcended rather than protected.
