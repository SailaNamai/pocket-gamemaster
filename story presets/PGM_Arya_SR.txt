<param-world>
Set in the Shadowrun universe:
	- Cybernetics, magic and fantasy creatures co-exist.
	- Industrial espionage and corporate warfare runs rampant
	- Large numbers of humans have "Goblinized" into Orks and Trolls, while many human children are born as Elves, Dwarves, and even more exotic creatures.

Sixth World:
	- The Sixth World is the world of today (2086 ). The Fifth World ended and the Sixth World began during the Awakening in 2011, when Magic returned to the world. A three-thousand-year lull in the flow of mystical energies subsided, and Magic returned to the world. Elves, Dwarfs, Orks, and Trolls assumed their true form, throwing off their human guise. The Awakening is the name given to the return of Magic in 2011, the Year of Chaos. The event signifies the beginning of the Sixth World of the Mayan Callender, a turning point to a new era of magic, drastically different from the Fifth World that preceded it. In a broader sense the Awakening describes the rise of the world mana level and the transformations of nature and humanity associated with it.
	- The decades that followed the Awakening were years of turmoil, panic, and chaos, as the Horsemen of the Apocalypse raced across the Earth. Primitives cultures that have never lost touch with their mystical past began to utilize magic against the great nations that had suppressed them for so long. The vast global telecommunications network collapsed under an assault by mysterious computer virus. Nuclear missiles were launched, but failed to detonate. Dragons soared in the skies. Epidemics and famine ravaged the face of the Earth. Clashes between newly Awakened races and the rest of humanity became common. All central authority crumbled and the world began to spiral down into an abyss. 
 
Races:
	- Characters can be humans, orks, trolls, elves, dwarves, as well as certain diverging subspecies (known as metavariants) such as gnomes, giants, dryads, etc. 
	- In the early days, when magic returned to the world, humans began to either change into, or give birth to, elf and dwarf infants, a phenomenon called Unexplained Genetic Expression (UGE). Later, some juvenile and adult humans "goblinized" into other races (mostly orks, but also some trolls). 
	- The term "metahuman" is used either to refer to humanity as a whole, including all races, or to refer specifically to non-human races, depending on context.

A shadowrun:
	- An attempt at data theft or physical break-in at a rival corporation or organization.
	- One of the main tools employed by both corporate rivals and underworld figures. 
	- When conflicts arise, corporations, governments, organized crime syndicates, and even wealthy individuals subcontract their dirty work to specialists, who then perform "shadowruns" or missions undertaken by deniable assets without identities or those that wish to remain unknown. The most skilled of these specialists, called shadowrunners, have earned a reputation for getting the job done.

Corporations:
	- Dubbed "megacorporations", "megacorps", or simply "megas" or "corps" for short. Megacorporations in the 21st-century are global, with all but the smallest corps owning multiple subsidiaries and divisions around the world. They are the superpowers of the Shadowrun universe, with the largest corporations having far more political, economic, and military power than even the most powerful nation-states. 

Archetypes:
	- Deckers are digital infiltrators. Their specialized cyberdeck and hacking skills allow them to breach security systems, steal critical data, manipulate electronic networks, and provide crucial intelligence.
	- Street samurai are enforcers for hire whose combat skills and reflexes make them the ultimate urban predators.
	- Riggers can manipulate vehicles and drones for a variety of purposes.
	- Mages, those rare folk who possess the gift of wielding and shaping the magical energies that now surround the Earth, are sought after to spy on the competition, heal and buff their allies, sling spells against an enemy, commit magical sabotage, and any other purpose that their employers can dream up.
	- Shamans are specialized mages whose attunement to the natural magical forces allows them to support themselves and fellow shadowrunners with a variety of defensive spells, as well as summon spirits in combat.
	- Physical adepts, who use the awakened magical energies to refine their bodies to the point of absolute perfection and become the ultimate fighting machines.

The Matrix:
	- Worldwide computer network. 
	- It was created after the Crash of 2029 which destroyed the old internet, as a completely Virtual Reality based network
	- The entire Matrix is composed of various Host Systems. People interact with this Matrix by using cyberterminals or cyberdecks. 
	- Security measures include potentially brain-destroying artificial intelligences called "Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics" (ICE)
