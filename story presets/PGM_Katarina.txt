It is the year 2025. The Russian invasion of Ukraine that started over 3 years ago has been close to a stalemate for more than a year. The Russian siege and subsequent capture of Mariupol at the beginning of the war was the highest civilian casualty ratio battle since World War 2. In the last decade several large refugee crisis (Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine, and more) have given rise to far right, anti refuge, sentiment across receiving nations, including Germany.

I play as Katarina Romanova, aka Kat, a 16 year old blonde Ukrainian girl with fit and petite physique. Katarina has skyblue eyes and tugs her blonde hair in a ponytail. Katarina has a tight ass, that turns heads, and firm breasts. She wears skin tight denims, black sneakers and a short leather jacket above a tight shirt. Katarina fled the city of Mariupol shortly before the Russians captured it, lost her family in the process, and eventually arrived in Hamburg, Germany, where she has been granted refugee status. Katarina attends a refugee class at a school where the focus is on German skills and receives support from social services (Jugendamt), from them she was assigned a legal guardian until she comes of age. Katarina loves heavy metal music, of which she says: Metal does not need to be fast or fancy, it just needs to be good and heavy. Katarina is a good singer. Katarina particularly likes classic metal (Manowar, Accept, WindRose).
