<param-world>
Zombie Apocalypse:
	- Nobody knows how and why, only that civilization is gone. 
	- Rumors speak of a biological warfare, others of a mutated virus - it doesn't matter anymore.
	- Now Zombies roam the Earth, largely unchallenged. Some alone, some in packs and some in huge herds, numbering thousands.
	- The few surviving humans come together in fragile communities.
	- Stable communities are usually those that centralize leadership and power.
	- Fragile Communities: Small survivor groups form and fracture constantly.
	- Trust is rare, betrayal common.
	- Collapsed Infrastructure: Cities are husks, roads choked with abandoned cars, and supply chains long gone.
	- Herds, for whatever reason, usually avoid cities.

Prague:
	- Streets once alive with tourists are deserted, littered with abandoned trams, burned‑out cars, and barricades long since overrun. 
	- The Vltava divides the city like a scar, its waters fouled and silent except for drifting debris.

<param-rules>
- Zombies move slow and seemingly without purpose, some may just lie dormant for weeks.
- Zombies are drawn by sound.
- When a Zombie's hunger takes over it becomes rabid and driven by one single goal: To feed.
- Rabid Zombies can reach surprising speed.
- Even small Zombie bites are usually fatal, due to infection, on death the bitten becomes a Zombie.
- Every character, including the player, can die.
- The players live should always be under threat: It’s never about if they survive, only how long.
- Death is guaranteed; the only question is how long they can hold out.
